# AlternateLife.RageMP.Net
![Build status](https://teamcity.alternate-life.de/app/rest/builds/buildType:(id:AlternateLife_RageMP_Net)/statusIcon)

AlternateLife.RageMP.Net is an alternative server-side .NET Core 2.1 implementation for [RAGE Multiplayer](https://rage.mp). This library targets more advanced developers which are more familiar with the RAGE Multiplayer server API and its features. It offers a mostly asynchronous API to interact with, so a thread-safe access to the native API is always guaranteed.

## Download & Installation

ℹ️ This library currently supports **win64** only!

**NuGet**

```text
PM> Install-Package AlternateLife.RageMP.Net
```

All releases are available for download in our [Releases page](https://github.com/AlternateLife/ragemp-dotnet-core/releases/latest). You can also find all instructions on how to get started in our [installation guide](https://ragemp.alternate-life.de/documentation/installation.html). 

## Documentation

You can find the latest AlternateLife.RageMP.Net documentation [here](https://ragemp.alternate-life.de). 

## Example

This is a sneak-peak on how to create the `Main`-class, so the server can find your entry point where to start from. 

```cs
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using AlternateLife.RageMP.Net.Enums;
using AlternateLife.RageMP.Net.Interfaces;
using AlternateLife.RageMP.Net.Scripting;

namespace AlternateLife.RageMP.Net.Example
{
    public class Main : IResource
    {
        public Main()
        {
            MP.Events.PlayerJoin += OnPlayerJoin;
            MP.Events.PlayerQuit += OnPlayerQuit;

            MP.Events.Add("PLAYER_INTERACT", OnPlayerInteract);
        }

        public Task OnStartAsync()
        {
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }

        public Task OnStopAsync()
        {
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }

        private Task OnPlayerJoin(IPlayer player)
        {
            MP.Logger.Info($"Player {player.SocialClubName} ({player.Ip}) joined");

            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }

        private void OnPlayerQuit(IPlayer player, DisconnectReason type, string reason)
        {
            MP.Logger.Info($"Player {player.SocialClubName} ({player.Ip}) left the server: {type.ToString()} ({reason})");
        }

        private Task OnPlayerInteract(IPlayer player, string eventname, object[] arguments)
        {
            var health = player.Health;

            health += 5;
            if (health > 100)
            {
                health = 100;
            }

            player.Health = health;

            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }
    }
}
```
